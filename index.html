    <p>For Assignment 3, I decided to create an Infographic around
        a video game that I play called Genshin Impact.
        <br>As for my ressearch, I decided to look into some research<br>
        that surrounding the game, such as how many times I played it
        throughtout the day, the enemies that I fought and the activities
        <br>that I did on a daily basis.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Prototype</h2>

    <p>For my original sketch, I was insipired by the graphics of
        the game and wanted to incorperate it into my poster.

      This is what my final looks like after some revision.
      <br>I tried to make the graphs more legible to read<br>
      since I noticed before the graphs were hard to read.
